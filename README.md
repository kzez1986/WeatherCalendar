# WeatherCalendar
Old project for IT studies. Currently application doesn't work, because WeatherUnderground currently doesn't provide weather data that application uses. But this project is an example of code with design patterns in C#.

Concept of application:

Download RSS feed with weather data from Weather Underground service and collect data. Application can count some data like monthly average temperature. User can revier weather data, historical data. Unfortunately, Weather Underground currently doesn't provide RSS feeds, so appplication doesn't work and it's not possible to quickly and easily fix it. Source code compiles well, but after it application crashes. Projest is for example of using design patterns and presents some concepts and ideas.
